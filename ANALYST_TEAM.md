## Customization

To modify analyst profiles, edit `ai_analyzer.py`:

```python
ANALYSTS = [
    AnalystProfile(
        name="Your Analyst Name",
        role="Their Job Title",
        personality="How they think/behave",
        model="ollama_model:tag",
        temperature=0.5,  # 0.0-1.0
        focus_area="What they focus on"
    ),
    # ... more analysts
]
```

**Recommended**: Keep 4-8 analysts for good coverage without excessive processing time
