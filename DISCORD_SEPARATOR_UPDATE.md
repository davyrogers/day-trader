# Discord Message Separator Update

## Change Made

Updated `src/discord_sender.py` to add a visual separator at the end of each Discord message.

## What It Does

Every message sent to Discord will now end with:
```
==================================================
```

This makes it much easier to see where one message ends and the next one begins in your Discord channel.

## Implementation Details

- **Separator**: 50 equal signs (`=`)
- **Location**: Added at the very end of each message
- **Character limit handling**: Even when messages are truncated due to Discord's 2000 character limit, the separator is preserved

## Example Output

Before:
```
🎯 TRADING SIGNAL - 2025-10-16
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 CONSENSUS: Watch
[rest of message...]
```

After:
```
🎯 TRADING SIGNAL - 2025-10-16
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 CONSENSUS: Watch
[rest of message...]
==================================================
```

## Benefits

✅ Clear visual separation between messages  
✅ Easier to track multiple analysis runs  
✅ Better readability in Discord channels  
✅ Works with all message types (analysis results, errors, etc.)

## Files Modified

- `src/discord_sender.py` - Added separator to all outgoing messages

## No Configuration Needed

This change is automatic and requires no configuration changes. Simply run your analysis as normal:

```bash
python run.py
```

All Discord messages will now include the separator automatically.

## Testing

The separator has been tested and verified to:
- ✅ Appear at the end of all messages
- ✅ Remain visible even when messages are truncated
- ✅ Not interfere with message formatting
- ✅ Work with both single and multiple executive committee decisions
