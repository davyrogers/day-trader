This document shows what the output looks like at each tier of analysis.

## Tier 1: Junior Analyst Reports (Examples)

### Marcus (Conservative Risk Manager)

```
MARCUS - RISK ASSESSMENT REPORT

KEY TIMING CONCERNS TODAY:
- 13:30 UTC: US CPI (Consumer Price Index) release - HIGH VOLATILITY RISK
- 15:00 UTC: Fed member speech - potential policy hints

EUR/USD OUTLOOK:
Direction: Neutral to slightly bearish
Confidence: MEDIUM

RISK FACTORS:
1. CPI surprise could trigger 50+ pip moves in either direction
2. Current EUR/USD at 1.0850 near key support - break below risky
3. Low liquidity windows: 12:00-13:00 UTC and 17:00-18:00 UTC

RECOMMENDATION:
AVOID trading 30 minutes before/after 13:30 UTC CPI release. If shorting EUR/USD, 
wait for CPI data confirmation. Stop loss mandatory at 1.0880 (30 pips max risk).

On £100 position: Risk £2.77 for potential £5.54 gain (1:2 R/R) if entry at 1.0850, 
target 1.0830, stop 1.0880.

Confidence: Would only trade with clear confirmation post-CPI.
```

### James (Aggressive Momentum Trader)

```
JAMES - MOMENTUM OPPORTUNITY REPORT

BULLISH SETUP ALERT:

The news flow suggests USD strength building ahead of CPI. Multiple sources citing 
positioning data showing EUR longs overcrowded - prime for squeeze.

EUR/USD SHORT OPPORTUNITY:
Entry: 1.0855-1.0860 (current level)
Target: 1.0800 (55 pips)
Stop: 1.0890 (30 pips)

TIMING: 
Enter NOW or on any bounce to 1.0860 before 13:00 UTC
Critical decision point: 13:30 UTC CPI

If CPI comes hot (>3.0%), expect violent move down to 1.0800-1.0780.

On £100: Risk £2.77 for £5.08 gain. Odds: 65% success if CPI hot.

HIGH CONVICTION - This is our play today.
```

### Elena (Fundamental Economist)

```
ELENA - ECONOMIC POLICY ANALYSIS

FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS TODAY:

1. US CPI (13:30 UTC): Market expects 2.9% YoY, 0.3% MoM
   - If >3.0%: USD strength, Fed stays hawkish
   - If <2.8%: USD weakness, rate cut hopes revive

2. ECB speech (15:30 UTC): Lagarde likely to maintain dovish stance
   - Euro zone growth concerns persist
   - Rate cuts still on table for Q2 2025

3. Geopolitical: No major events today

MACROECONOMIC VIEW:
USD fundamentally stronger than EUR currently. Rate differential favors USD 
(Fed 4.5-4.75% vs ECB 3.25%). Economic growth divergence supports USD.

EUR/USD FUNDAMENTAL BIAS: Bearish (favor shorts)

BEST TIMING: Post-CPI confirmation of hot inflation (>3.0%)

RISK/REWARD: On £100, shorting at 1.0850 with 30 pip stop (£2.77 risk) and 
50 pip target (£4.62 gain) = 1:1.67 R/R. Probability ~60% if fundamentals 
play out as expected.

## Tier 2: Senior Manager Synthesis

```
SENIOR TRADING MANAGER - CONSOLIDATED REPORT

I've reviewed all 6 analyst reports. Here's the synthesis:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CONSENSUS AREAS (4+ analysts agree):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. CRITICAL TIME: 13:30 UTC - US CPI Release
   - ALL analysts flag this as today's key event
   - Expected: 2.9% YoY | Hot = >3.0% | Cool = <2.8%

2. DIRECTIONAL BIAS: Bearish EUR/USD
   - 5 of 6 analysts favor shorts (only David contrarian)
   - Fundamental support: Rate differentials, growth divergence
   - Technical support: Overcrowded EUR longs (positioning data)

3. RISK MANAGEMENT: Avoid pre-CPI trading
   - Marcus, Sarah, Elena all warn: 30 min buffer around 13:30 UTC
   - Volatility window: 13:00-14:00 UTC = danger zone

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DIVERGENT VIEWS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

David (Contrarian) warns: "Everyone short EUR/USD = contrarian long?"
- Valid point BUT fundamentals still support USD
- His concern: Crowded trade could reverse on soft CPI
- Committee note: This is why we wait for CPI confirmation

James (Aggressive) wants to enter NOW
- Marcus and Sarah advise WAIT for CPI data
- Priya notes sentiment too bullish on USD = some risk

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TRADE SETUP (Consensus):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Pair: EUR/USD SHORT
Trigger: CPI >3.0% (hot inflation)
Entry: 1.0845-1.0850 (post-CPI spike)
Stop Loss: 1.0890 (40 pips = £3.69 on £100)
Target: 1.0800 (50 pips = £4.62 on £100)
R/R: 1:1.25
Probability: 60-65% (analysts' avg)

TIMING WINDOWS:
- 13:30 UTC: CPI release - WAIT for data
- 13:35-14:00 UTC: Entry window IF CPI hot
- 15:30 UTC: ECB speech - monitor for EUR support

RECOMMENDATION TO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE:
Opportunity exists IF CPI comes hot. Risk is elevated due to event volatility
and potentially crowded trade. Suggest CONDITIONAL approval: execute only if
CPI >3.0% and price action confirms downside momentum.
```

## Tier 3: Executive Committee Final Decision

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 TRADING SIGNAL - Oct 16, 2025
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 CONSENSUS: CONDITIONAL YES (Execute only if CPI >3.0%)

⏰ KEY TIMES (UTC):
• 13:30 - US CPI release (CRITICAL - wait for data)
• 13:35-14:00 - Entry window IF conditions met
• 15:30 - ECB speech (monitor, likely non-event)

💹 TRADE SETUP:
Pair: EUR/USD
Direction: SHORT
Entry: 1.0845-1.0850 AFTER hot CPI (>3.0%)
Stop: 1.0890 (40 pips)
Target: 1.0800 (50 pips)

Risk: £3.69 on £100 position
Reward: £4.62 potential
Odds: 60% success IF CPI >3.0%

CALCULATION: 40 pip stop = 0.0040 / 1.0850 = 0.369% loss = £3.69
            50 pip target = 0.0050 / 1.0850 = 0.462% gain = £4.62

⚠️ RISKS:
1. Event volatility - CPI can cause 50-100 pip whipsaws
2. Crowded trade - many shorts could reverse on soft CPI
3. Slippage risk - fast market, fills may vary

🎲 EXECUTIVE DECISION:
DO NOT trade before 13:30 UTC. WAIT for CPI data. IF CPI comes in >3.0% (hot 
inflation), this confirms Fed stays hawkish and USD strength continues. Enter 
short at 1.0845-1.0850 ONLY if price shows downward momentum post-CPI. Tight 
stop at 1.0890 mandatory. If CPI <2.8% (cool), NO TRADE - bias flips bullish.

Committee vote: 2-1 approve (conditional execution only)
