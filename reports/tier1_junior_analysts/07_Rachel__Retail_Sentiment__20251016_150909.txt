I’m ready to dive into the day’s data, but I’ll need the specific news releases and any market‑moving events that were announced today (with their exact UTC/GMT timestamps). Once you provide that, I can:

1. Map out the exact timing of each event.  
2. Break down how retail traders are likely to interpret each piece of news versus what the fundamentals actually indicate.  
3. Pinpoint precise windows (in UTC/GMT) where a short‑EUR/USD trade that rides the prevailing trend could be most attractive.  
4. Assign a confidence level to each idea and back it up with concrete evidence – from behavioral patterns, historical retail mis‑steps, and the news sentiment itself.

Please paste the list of today’s releases (or a brief summary of the key headlines) and I’ll get the analysis rolling.
