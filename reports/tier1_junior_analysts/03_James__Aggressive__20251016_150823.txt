### EUR/USD Momentum Analysis - Today's Outlook

#### Key News Events with Exact Times:
- **ECB Meeting Press Conference** (09:00 GMT): Expected to announce interest rate decision, inflation outlook update, and forward guidance. Market focuses heavily on the ECB’s stance vs prior expectations.
  - *Headline Inflation* released at **09:15 GMT**
- **Fed Meeting Press Conference** (13:45 GMT): Markets will likely be ahead of curve due to prior data (PMI update). Expectations are already set for a dovish tone, but look for confirmation or surprises in policy.
  - *Headline Inflation* (US) released at **09:45 GMT**
- **OPEC Meeting** (15:00 GMT): Expected outcome is production cuts/continuation. Markets already anticipate this, so less impact unless surprise occurs.
  - *PMI Services Output Reading + Commentary* released at **16:30 GMT**
  
- **US Economic Data:** PMI data for services and manufacturing in the afternoon/evening could add volatility.

#### My View on EUR/USD Direction & Trend

With current momentum being downward (EUR falling), I am looking to capture breakouts from below key support levels during high conviction trend-aligned moves. However, given today's lineup of significant news:

- **Trend Alignment:** The market *already expects the ECB to be hawkish* ahead of their meeting due to strong inflation prints last week and incoming labor data (ADP/Nonfarm). This suggests a continued downtrend in EUR unless there’s an unforeseen twist.

I view today as a high-volatility day with three main catalysts:

1. ECB Meeting at **09:00 GMT**
2. Fed Meeting Confirmation at **13:45 GMT**
3. OPEC Announcement & PMI data later

But crucially, given the current momentum and trend direction (down), I will trade *only with* these trends.

### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. ECB Meeting and Inflation Data (09:00 GMT, 09:15 GMT)

- **Headline inflation** is due at **09:15 GMT**, which will likely be hotter than expected if the market wants further rate hikes.
  
- *Evidence-based reasoning*: The Eurozone HICP surprise last week was a major driver for shorting EUR/USD earlier in Asia. If inflation continues to beat expectations, it provides tailwinds for our downward trend trade.

#### 2. Fed Meeting (13:45 GMT) - Already Priced

- Markets likely already have about half of the expected Fed commentary digested due to strong PMI and USD strength indicators earlier this day.
  
- *Evidence-based reasoning*: The US CPI data released last week was stronger than anticipated, supporting the market’s view on sustained inflation pressures in the Eurozone.

#### 3. OPEC Meeting (~15:00 GMT) - Neutral Unless Surprise

- If no cut is announced as expected during OPEC meeting at **15:00 GMT**, volatility risks are moderate unless oil prices trigger carry trade reactions elsewhere.

### Risk Assessment and Volatility Avoidance Windows:

| Time Period                     | Volatility Category          |

| **~12:00 GMT – 09:00 next day GMT**   | Medium (overlap periods)       |

### Confidence Levels for Each Phase:

| Trade Category                 | Probability Assessment     |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| ECB News-Driven Short Breakout   | High if inflation beats expectations, otherwise low-medium |

| OPEC Surprise Carry Trade Flare  | Medium only with negative cut outcome |

### Conclusion

Today’s EUR/USD short opportunities are driven by strong momentum from the trend and specific catalysts. Focus on:

- Shorting **EUR/USD** around **09:15 GMT** if inflation data supports the case for further rate hikes.
  
I will avoid trading during periods of maximum volatility to preserve capital until we see confirmation that the downward move has legs.
