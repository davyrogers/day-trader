Each manager has different temperature settings for varying perspectives:

1. **Senior Manager Alpha (Conservative)** - Temperature 0.25
   - Ultra-conservative approach
   - Strict validation of recommendations

### 3. Evidence-Based Reasoning Requirement

**ALL analysts now MUST provide:**
- Specific evidence for each conclusion
- Citations of news items, data points, or historical patterns
- No speculation or made-up facts allowed
- Clear reasoning chains from evidence to recommendation

### 4. Real-Time Market Data Integration

#### **New Market Data System**
Created `src/market_data.py` with:
- `MarketDataFetcher` class - Fetches real-time forex data
- Multiple free API integrations:
  - exchangerate-api.com (primary)
  - frankfurter.app (ECB data backup)
  - fixer.io (with API key)
- Automatic instrument detection from news
- 60-second caching to reduce API calls
- Graceful fallback when APIs unavailable

#### **Market Data Provided to Managers**
- Current price (bid/ask)
- Bid/ask spread (in pips)
- 24-hour range
- Data source and timestamp
- Spread calculations

#### **Integration Points**
- Management layers receive market data via `{{MARKET_DATA}}` placeholder
- Data is injected into senior manager and executive committee prompts
- Enables validation of analyst recommendations against current prices
- Prevents made-up price levels in recommendations

### 5. Enhanced Analysis Pipeline

#### **Sequential Mode**
1. Fetch real-time market data
2. Run 15 junior analysts
3. Run 4 senior managers (with market data)
4. Run 3 executive committees (with market data)
5. Return all 3 executive decisions

#### **Concurrent Mode** 
1. Fetch real-time market data
2. Run 15 junior analysts in parallel
3. Run 4 senior managers in parallel (with market data)
4. Run 3 executive committees in parallel (with market data)
5. Return all 3 executive decisions

### 6. Output Format Enhancement

Final output now includes:
- All 3 executive committee decisions clearly separated
- Committee name and role for each decision
- Real-time market data in each recommendation
- Specific price levels based on current market
- Risk/reward calculations using real prices

## Configuration File Updates

## Usage Example

```python
from src.ai_analyzer import ForexAnalysisPipeline

# Initialize with optional market data API key
pipeline = ForexAnalysisPipeline(
    ollama_base_url="http://localhost:11434",
    run_concurrent=True,
    config_path="analyst_team.json",
    market_data_api_key="your_api_key_here"  # Optional
)

# Run analysis - market data fetched automatically
result = pipeline.analyze_news(aggregated_news_data)

# Result contains 3 executive committee decisions
print(result)
```

## Next Steps / Recommendations

1. **Test with Real Data**
   - Run the enhanced system with actual news feeds
   - Compare outputs from different executive committees
   - Evaluate quality of devil's advocate analysis

2. **Monitor API Usage**
   - Track market data API calls
   - Ensure caching is working
   - Consider paid API if free tier limits reached

3. **Fine-Tune Temperatures**
   - Adjust analyst and manager temperatures based on output quality
   - May need tweaking after observing actual behavior

4. **Add More Data Sources**
   - Consider adding volume data
   - Add support/resistance levels from technical analysis APIs
   - Integrate order book data if available

5. **Enhance Instrument Detection**
   - Improve automatic instrument detection from news
   - Support more forex pairs automatically
   - Add support for other asset classes (stocks, crypto, commodities)

## Files Modified

1. `analyst_team.json` - Complete configuration overhaul
2. `src/ai_analyzer.py` - Enhanced pipeline with market data integration
3. `src/market_data.py` - NEW file for market data fetching

## Breaking Changes

None - the system is backward compatible. If market data fetching fails, it gracefully falls back and continues analysis.
