# Report Saving Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Changed

The AI analysis pipeline now automatically saves all analyst reports to the `reports/` folder.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Folder Management
- **Clears `reports/` folder on each run** - Only the latest analysis is kept
- **Creates organized subdirectories**:
  - `tier1_junior_analysts/`
  - `tier2_senior_managers/`
  - `tier3_executive_committees/`

### 2. Individual Report Saving
Every analyst's output is saved as a separate file with:
- Numbered prefix (shows execution order)
- Analyst name
- Timestamp
- Full formatted content with headers

**Example filename**: `01_Sarah_Market_Sentiment_20251016_143022.txt`

### 3. Comprehensive Final Summary
A `FINAL_SUMMARY_[timestamp].txt` file includes:
- Pipeline statistics (number of analysts at each tier)
- Executive decisions (what was sent to Discord)
- References to detailed reports
- Complete timestamp of the run

### 4. Works in Both Modes
- **Sequential mode**: Reports saved as each analyst completes
- **Concurrent mode**: Reports saved as analysts finish (may be in parallel)

## Benefits

✅ **Full Transparency** - Review every AI decision made during analysis  
✅ **Quality Control** - Verify analyst reasoning and catch issues  
✅ **Learning Tool** - Understand how insights flow through tiers  
✅ **No Clutter** - Old reports automatically cleared each run  
✅ **Easy Navigation** - Organized by tier with numbered, timestamped files  

## Console Output

You'll now see lines like:
```
✓ Reports directory cleared and ready: C:\Repos\day-trader\reports
✓ Sarah (Market Sentiment Analyst) report complete
  → Saved report: 01_Sarah_Market_Sentiment_20251016_143022.txt
```

## File Locations

All reports are in `c:\Repos\day-trader\reports\`:
- Individual analyst reports in tier folders
- `FINAL_SUMMARY_[timestamp].txt` in the root of reports folder
- `README.md` explaining the structure

## Code Changes

Modified `src/ai_analyzer.py`:
- Added `shutil` import for folder clearing
- New `_setup_reports_directory()` method
- New `_save_report()` method for individual reports
- New `_save_final_summary()` method for comprehensive summary
- Updated both sequential and concurrent pipelines to save reports

## Usage

No configuration needed! Just run your analysis as normal:
```bash
python run.py
```

Reports will automatically be saved and available for review.
